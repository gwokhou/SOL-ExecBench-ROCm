# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-05-23)

**Core value:** Evaluate LLM-generated GPU kernels correctly and reproducibly on AMD ROCm hardware while preserving the benchmark semantics and rigor of SOL ExecBench.
**Current focus:** Phase 47: Derivation Contract And Golden Fixture Matrix

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.10 scope is SOLAR derivation only.
- Preserve canonical trace JSONL, public schemas, primary CLI behavior, and AMD-native-derived claim boundaries.
- Defer 124-model/235-problem extraction, MI300X/CDNA3/CDNA4 validation, NVFP4/MXFP4 validation, hosted leaderboard, NVIDIA Blackwell/B200 equivalence, and new framework dependencies.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
