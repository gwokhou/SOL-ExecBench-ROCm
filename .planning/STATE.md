## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.10 scope is SOLAR derivation only.
- Preserve canonical trace JSONL, public schemas, primary CLI behavior, and AMD-native-derived claim boundaries.
- Defer 124-model/235-problem extraction, MI300X/CDNA3/CDNA4 validation, NVFP4/MXFP4 validation, hosted leaderboard, NVIDIA Blackwell/B200 equivalence, and new framework dependencies.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
