# SOL ExecBench ROCm Port

## What This Is

SOL ExecBench ROCm Port is a ROCm-only fork of SOL ExecBench for evaluating
LLM-generated GPU kernels on AMD GPUs. It keeps the original benchmark
semantics and public contracts where practical while replacing CUDA/NVIDIA
runtime, build, timing, environment, example, and documentation paths with ROCm
equivalents.

## Core Value

Evaluate LLM-generated GPU kernels correctly and reproducibly on AMD ROCm
hardware while preserving the benchmark semantics and rigor of SOL ExecBench.

## Current State

**Shipped version:** v1.3 Non-CDNA Issue Closure, archived 2026-05-22.

The v1.0 milestone migrated the repository to a ROCm-only runtime baseline. The
v1.1 milestone added CDNA 3 code/schema support, maintained active
CUDA/NVIDIA-residue audit coverage, ROCm-facing public example paths, clarified
compatibility-example metadata, and a concrete CDNA 3 hardware validation
handoff for a future milestone. The v1.2 milestone harvested selected
engineering practices from `hip-execbench` as internal diagnostics, reporting,
score-interpretation guardrails, and public-contract tests without changing
external schemas, CLI behavior, trace formats, or examples. The v1.3 milestone
closed non-CDNA residual gaps by comparing the ROCm port
against NVIDIA SOL ExecBench's original public functionality and selectively
borrowing engineering practices from
`~/PyCharmMiscProject/hip-playground/hip-execbench`. The milestone excluded real
CDNA 3 hardware validation and any CDNA 3 hardware-validation claim.

Validation status:

- RDNA 4 (`gfx1200`) full adapted suite passed: `462 passed, 58 skipped`.
- CDNA 3 (`gfx940`, `gfx941`, `gfx942`) is supported by schema/build/docs.
- CDNA 3 (`gfx94*`) full adapted suite validation remains deferred by user
  decision and must be completed before claiming CDNA 3 hardware validation.

## Current Milestone: v1.4 hip-execbench Engineering Experience Adaptation + Validation Workflow Readiness

**Goal:** Learn and adapt strong engineering practices from
`~/PyCharmMiscProject/hip-playground/hip-execbench` while preserving this
project's public SOL ExecBench ROCm contracts; implement CDNA 3 validation
readiness without claiming hardware validation, and validate the implemented
RDNA 4 path with unit and E2E evidence.

**Target features:**

- Identify `hip-execbench` engineering practices worth adapting, including
  pipeline stage results, compile-cache discipline, diagnostics/profiling
  readiness, agent/report transformations, baseline comparison, and statistical
  comparison patterns.
- Adapt selected practices as additive or internal enhancements only: keep the
  existing `sol-execbench` CLI behavior, public schemas, trace JSONL contract,
  solution format, and benchmark semantics stable.
- Implement CDNA 3 validation workflow readiness for `gfx94*`, including
  environment detection, validation entry points, result/evidence collection,
  failure diagnostics, evidence templates, and acceptance criteria, without
  requiring or claiming a real CDNA 3 hardware pass in this milestone.
- Implement and validate the RDNA 4 path with focused unit tests and full E2E
  validation evidence.
- Preserve existing reference correctness, timing integrity, reward-hack
  defenses, ROCm-only schema/build/eval behavior, and compatibility guardrails.

## Requirements

### Validated

- Existing CLI can load definitions, workloads, solutions, and emit trace results through `sol-execbench` - existing.

  inspection without changing public CLI or trace contracts - v1.2.
- SOL-Score interpretation guardrails warn against unsupported AMD-native
  performance claims while preserving the existing score formula - v1.2.
- Public contract guardrail tests protect schemas, CLI help, trace behavior,
  HIP-facing examples, and CDNA 3 validation deferral language - v1.2.
- Original NVIDIA SOL ExecBench public functionality is mapped to ROCm port
  disposition with tests protecting parity documentation - v1.3.
- Public baseline comparison over existing trace JSONL is available through
  `sol-execbench-baseline` without changing trace schemas or the main benchmark
  CLI - v1.3.

  `hipblas`, `miopen`, `ck`, and `rocwmma` replacement directions - v1.3.
- `hip-execbench` baseline/reporting practices have been selectively adapted or
  explicitly rejected according to SOL ExecBench public-contract constraints -
  v1.3.
- Non-CDNA validation debt is closed; real CDNA 3 hardware validation remains
  the only deferred project-level item - v1.3.

### Active

- [ ] Adapt selected `hip-execbench` engineering practices without changing
      existing public interfaces or benchmark contracts.
- [ ] Implement CDNA 3 validation workflow readiness while keeping real CDNA 3
      hardware validation deferred.
- [ ] Validate RDNA 4 implementation paths with unit and E2E evidence.

### Out of Scope

- Maintaining CUDA/NVIDIA runtime compatibility - ROCm is the target platform for this port.
- Preserving NVIDIA-specific dependency implementations when a ROCm replacement is required - equivalent behavior matters more than retaining original code.
- Guaranteeing one-to-one high-performance replacements for every NVIDIA DSL - some former CUTLASS/cuDNN/CuTe/cuTile categories remain documented compatibility examples or candidates.
- Claiming CDNA 3 hardware validation before a full `gfx94*` suite pass is recorded.

## Context

The current codebase is now ROCm-oriented. `docker/Dockerfile` uses a ROCm
development base image. Python dependency declarations point PyTorch and
torchvision at ROCm wheels. The package remains a Python CLI benchmark runner:
`src/sol_execbench/cli/main.py` loads problem JSON, `ProblemPackager` stages
files and injects AMD architecture flags, and `src/sol_execbench/driver/templates/`
contains the HIP-aware build and eval subprocess scripts.

High-risk areas for future work remain real CDNA 3 hardware validation, native
library replacement quality, timing integrity on additional AMD architectures,
and AMD-native score interpretation. v1.4 focuses on adapting useful
`hip-execbench` engineering practices and implementing validation readiness
without changing public contracts or claiming unperformed CDNA 3 hardware
validation.

## Constraints

- **Platform**: ROCm >= 7.0 is the supported software baseline.
- **Hardware**: RDNA 4 is validated; CDNA 3 is code/schema-supported but hardware validation remains deferred.
- **Compatibility**: Preserve SOL ExecBench benchmark semantics and public schemas unless a ROCm-specific change is unavoidable.
- **Scope**: NVIDIA/CUDA runtime support is intentionally not maintained.
- **Licensing**: All retained and replacement code must comply with the repository LICENSE and third-party dependency obligations.
- **Quality**: Migrated tests, examples, Docker checks, and end-to-end evaluation must pass under ROCm.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| ROCm-only port | User explicitly chose to replace NVIDIA/CUDA paths rather than maintain dual backend compatibility. | Validated in v1.0 |
| Broad solution ecosystem target | User chose to pursue ROCm equivalents for all original solution categories, not just HIP-only or a minimal subset. | Partially validated in v1.1; some former NVIDIA DSL categories remain compatibility examples/documented candidates |
| Adapted test suite is the completion gate | User defined done as passing the migrated existing tests on ROCm, rather than adding a separate parity suite as v1 scope. | Validated on RDNA 4 in v1.0 |
| Preserve benchmark standards | The port should remain consistent with the NVIDIA SOL ExecBench paper and implementation standards wherever feasible. | Validated for public schemas and eval semantics in v1.0 |
| Defer CDNA 3 validation | No CDNA 3 hardware run was available during closure. | Accepted as v1.0 technical debt |
| Separate CDNA 3 code support from hardware validation | User requested CDNA 3 support in v1.1 while deferring real hardware validation to the next milestone. | Validated in v1.1 |
| Preserve public interfaces during practice harvest | User requested borrowing engineering experience from `hip-execbench` without changing this project's external interfaces or formats. | Validated in v1.2 |
| Close non-CDNA gaps before CDNA hardware validation | User requested v1.3 converge all issues except CDNA 3 validation, using NVIDIA SOL ExecBench parity and `hip-execbench` engineering experience as references. | Validated in v1.3 |
| Preserve compatibility during v1.4 engineering adaptation | User requested comprehensive `hip-execbench` engineering practice adaptation without breaking existing CLI, schema, trace, solution, or benchmark semantics. | Pending in v1.4 |
| Implement CDNA 3 readiness without hardware claim | User clarified v1.4 should implement CDNA 3 validation workflow readiness but not perform or claim real CDNA 3 validation. | Pending in v1.4 |
| RDNA 4 is the validation platform for v1.4 | User clarified v1.4 implementation must be validated on RDNA 4 with unit and E2E evidence. | Pending in v1.4 |

2. Core Value check - still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope - reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
