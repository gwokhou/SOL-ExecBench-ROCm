"""Handlers for cumulative/scan operations.

This module provides einsum handlers for:
- cumsum: cumulative sum along a dimension
- cumprod: cumulative product along a dimension
- cummax: cumulative maximum along a dimension
- cummin: cumulative minimum along a dimension

These operations are NOT reductions - they preserve the input shape.
Based on PyTorch documentation:
https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cumsum.html

For example, cumsum on input of size N returns output of size N:
    y[i] = x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i]
